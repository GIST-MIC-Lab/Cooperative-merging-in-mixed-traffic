# Cooperative Merging in Mixed Traffic Based on Strategic Influence of Connected Automated Vehicles on Human-Driven Vehicle Behavior

Cooperative on-ramp merging control for connected and automated vehicles (CAVs) can significantly improve traffic flow and fuel efficiency at highway merging points. However, in mixed traffic scenarios where CAVs coexist with human-driven vehicles (HDVs), the unpredictable behavior of HDVs poses challenges to safety and coordination. Although many cooperative merging strategies focus on individual CAV control, fewer efforts have addressed the coordination of multiple CAVs in such environments. This study introduces an optimization-based cooperative merging strategy for all CAVs within a control zone, considering interactions with HDVs with uncertain intentions.
